Interpretable Machine Learning to understand Participant Evolution in Longitudinal Cohort Study Data

## Tasks
### Design and implementation of a visual exploration tool which would include features to :
* Measure the influence of each evolution feature on the predicted class.
* Evaluate the merit of an evolution feature towards classification accuracy.
* Analyse the minimal change in the participant such that the predicted class label changes. 
* Identify the minimal set of evolution features that would result in better predictive performance.

### R Libraries Used:
* tidyverse
* testthat
* evoxploit : https://github.com/unmnn/evoxploit
* rmarkdown
* ggplot2
